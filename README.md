ðŸ¦œ Parrot Talk
A Conversational Engine for Adventures That Speak Back

Parrot Talk is the dialogue and personality layer for story-driven games â€” where every character has something witty, cryptic, or heartfelt to say.
Originally built for Rumbrain, it powers interactive conversations in point-and-click and text-based adventures inspired by classics like Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle.

ðŸŽ­ Concept

In the world of Parrot Talk, NPCs (non-player characters) arenâ€™t just static lines of dialogue â€” they listen, think, and respond based on player actions, context, and curiosity.

Players might:

Ask the town gossip about that strange ship in the harbor.

Try to pick up an unwilling parrot (and get a snarky reply).

Whisper secrets to a statue and see if it answers back.

Each interaction becomes part of a living conversation tree that reflects the worldâ€™s current state â€” making every playthrough a little different.

ðŸ§  How It Works

Parrot Talk is built on a few core ideas:

Dialogue Nodes: Characters speak through connected nodes that define their tone, triggers, and responses.

Context Awareness: NPCs know the playerâ€™s progress, inventory, and recent events.

Dynamic Mood: Repeated actions or story progress can alter how characters react.

Extensible Logic: Easily integrate AI-driven or rule-based responses for richer conversations.
